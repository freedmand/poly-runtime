/**
 * This file provides functionality related to channels
 *
 * Data flows through channels. A channel is a way to communicate when data
 * changes. There are multiple different types of channels:
 *
 * - data channels: a data channel is the simplest kind of channel. It is
 *   connected to underlying data that can be changed
 * - automatic channels: an automatic channel is connected to other channels and
 *   has a value that is dependent on them. For instance, in a data
 *   representation of a person, there might be a data channel for age. There
 *   might be an automatic channel for whether the person is an adult or not
 *   that is connected to the age channel. Automatic channels cannot be changed
